    I am a second-year PhD student at the [TACO Lab](https://taco-group.github.io/) in Computer Science at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Zhengzhong Tu](https://vztu.github.io/). 
    I received my Master of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Professor [Peixin Ye](http://en.math.nankai.edu.cn/2015/1112/c4059a32170/page.htm) in 2023. 
    Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science degree at [Ningxia University](http://www.nxu.edu.cn/) in 2020. From 2022 to 2023, I was a research intern at the [Statistics and Machine Learning Research Group](https://statml.hkust.edu.hk/)
    , the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am fortunate to have been working closely with Dr. [Shizhe Diao](https://shizhediao.github.io/) (NVIDIA Research).
